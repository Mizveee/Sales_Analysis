![](Store.jpg)
---

## Introduction
This is a sales analytic on raw data from Nestle, Australia. Power BI was used to develop a report to help the company take decision on its expansion plans. The company needed actionable insights to expand its business by adding new product lines and also needed to check how the product were performing across locations and especially what sales medium was preferred by customers across board.

## Problem Statement
1.	What is the total revenue for each year and the month with the highest revenue?
2.	What is the product with the highest and lowest revenue?
3.	What location had the highest and lowest sales?
4.	What location has the most sales and the medium used more in each location
5.	What is the month with the highest revenue in each year?
6.	What is the trend of sales per month?
7.	What is the trend of total sales per product in the last 3 years?
8.	Which sales medium generated the most revenue?
   
## Skills/Concept Demonstrated
The following features in Power BI was incorporated:
- Extract, Transform, Load
- Power Query
- DAX
  
## Data Modelling 
No modelling was required as the dataset contained only one table.

## Data Transformation
I downloaded the dataset as a csv file from its source and imported it into Power Query. The dataset was quite clean but I did a little transformation by splitting the sales date column into year and month column then assigned appropriate datatypes to each columns in the dataset before loading it into Power BI. I also calculated the KPIs by creating measures in Power BI which helps in the result of our analysis. Several charts and slicers were then used to design a dynamic and interactive dashboard which helped me to generate insight into the operation of the company.

## Recommendation
With the world being a global village, it is expected that online sales should be one of the highest performing medium through which customer purchase products. It is expected to bridge the gap between location and customers but based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the online medium has performed below its potential. It is therefore recommended that special attention be given to the online platform to see what could lead to its low performance. Factors such as a difficult user interface i.e. the website for online purchase not being user friendly, late delivery of goods purchased by customers through the online medium and a general lack of trust in product quality found online as compared to seeing it for themselves in stores might be factors contributing to the low usage of the online medium.
